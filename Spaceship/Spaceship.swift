//  The position property is how far spaceshipView.center is to the right (positive) or left
//  (negative) of spaceView.center.  This distance is measured in multiples of the
//  spaceshipView's width.  For example, if position = 2 and the spaceshipView's width is 30,
//  then spaceshipView.center would be 60 pixels to the right of spaceView.center.
